Data Cleaning:

Converted variable types to appropriate formats.
Filled missing values (NaNs) with suitable replacements.
Conducted initial data exploration to understand the dataset better.


Streamlit Application:

Learned how to build and deploy a web application using Streamlit.
Implemented data visualization and interactive features using Streamlit and Plotly.


Features

Data Preprocessing: Includes data type conversion, handling missing values, and basic exploratory data analysis.
Streamlit Integration: Developed an interactive web application to visualize car data.
Visualization: Created plots and charts to represent data trends and patterns effectively.
